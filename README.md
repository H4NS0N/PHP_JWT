PHP login function with JWT.

JWT ensures that parts of the application will only be accesible through various roles. Like a user should administrate a CRUD frunction of new products. With the JWT, we can store user data, identify the user roles, while JWT encrypts the user data for the public eye. 

This will ensure high security and checks upon login and thus makes it harder to fake a role or do malicious actions from outsiders.
